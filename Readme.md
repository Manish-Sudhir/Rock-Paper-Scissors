This is a computer vision project encapsulating a rock-paper-scissor game with the computer. This project is written in python and utilises tensorflow ti build the NN model
and opencv to access the sysrems computer to read users input. 
The objective of the game is to face the computer in a best of three series in the classic rock paper scissors game. The computer will randomly play a choice.
Users are also able to not play anything this is referred to the "nothing" option. Draws are also possible for a particular round. Note: If the user plays nothing the computer will win that round regardless.
The game can be played by running the python script from the camera_rps.py file. The terminal will prompt the user when to play their choice and the terminal will
keep a tab on the number of computer and user wins. The game will end once the user or computer wins 3 games.
